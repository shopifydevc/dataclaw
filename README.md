# DataClaw

Turn your Claude Code conversation history into structured training data and publish it to Hugging Face with a single command. DataClaw parses session logs, redacts secrets and PII, and uploads the result as a ready-to-use dataset — so the hours you spend coding with Claude can help make future models better.

All DataClaw datasets are tagged **`dataclaw`** — [browse them all](https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=dataclaw).

## Getting started

Paste this into Claude Code (or any coding agent):

```
Help me export my Claude Code conversation history to Hugging Face using DataClaw.
Install it, set up the skill, then walk me through the process.

STEP 1 — INSTALL
  pip install dataclaw
  If that fails: git clone https://github.com/banodoco/dataclaw.git /tmp/dataclaw && pip install /tmp/dataclaw
  If that also fails, ask the user where the source is.

STEP 2 — INSTALL SKILL
  dataclaw update-skill claude

STEP 3 — START
  dataclaw prep
  Every dataclaw command outputs next_steps in its JSON — follow them through the entire flow.

IMPORTANT: Never run bare `huggingface-cli login` — always use --token.
IMPORTANT: Always export with --no-push first and review for PII before publishing.
```

<summary><b>Manual usage (without an agent)</b></summary>

### Quick start

```bash
pip install dataclaw
huggingface-cli login --token YOUR_TOKEN

# See your projects
dataclaw prep

# Configure
dataclaw config --repo username/dataclaw-username
dataclaw config --exclude "personal-stuff,scratch"
dataclaw config --redact-usernames "my_github_handle,my_discord_name"
dataclaw config --redact "my-domain.com,my-secret-project"

# Export locally first
dataclaw export --no-push

# Review and confirm
dataclaw confirm

# Push
dataclaw export
```

| Extended thinking | Yes | Claude's reasoning (opt out with `--no-thinking`) |
| Tool calls | Yes | Tool name + summarized input |
| Tool results | No | Not stored in Claude Code's logs |
| Token usage | Yes | Input/output tokens per session |
| Model & metadata | Yes | Model name, git branch, timestamps |

### Privacy & Redaction

DataClaw applies multiple layers of protection:

1. **Path anonymization** — File paths stripped to project-relative
2. **Username hashing** — Your macOS username + any configured usernames replaced with stable hashes
3. **Secret detection** — Regex patterns catch JWT tokens, API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, HF, GitHub, AWS, etc.), database passwords, private keys, Discord webhooks, and more
4. **Entropy analysis** — Long high-entropy strings in quotes are flagged as potential secrets
5. **Email redaction** — Personal email addresses removed
6. **Custom redaction** — You can configure additional strings and usernames to redact
7. **Tool input pre-redaction** — Secrets in tool inputs are redacted BEFORE truncation to prevent partial leaks

**This is NOT foolproof.** Always review your exported data before publishing.
Automated redaction cannot catch everything — especially service-specific
identifiers, third-party PII, or secrets in unusual formats.

Each line in `conversations.jsonl` is one session:

```json

  "git_branch": "main",
  "start_time": "2025-06-15T10:00:00+00:00",

      "content": "I'll investigate the login flow.",
      "thinking": "The user wants me to look at...",

Each HF repo also includes a `metadata.json` with aggregate stats.

<summary><b>Finding datasets on Hugging Face</b></summary>

All repos are named `{username}/dataclaw-{username}` and tagged `dataclaw`.

- **Browse all:** [huggingface.co/datasets?other=dataclaw](https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=dataclaw)
- **Load one:**
  ```python
  from datasets import load_dataset
  ds = load_dataset("alice/dataclaw-alice", split="train")
  ```
- **Combine several:**
  ```python
  from datasets import load_dataset, concatenate_datasets
  repos = ["alice/dataclaw-alice", "bob/dataclaw-bob"]
  ds = concatenate_datasets([load_dataset(r, split="train") for r in repos])
  ```

The auto-generated HF README includes:
- Model distribution (which Claude models, how many sessions each)
- Total token counts
- Project count
- Last updated timestamp
